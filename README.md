# Shift UK

This archival repository contains the original Shift UK website, which my dear brother Caleb and I put together close to a decade ago. It was originally written in PHP, but I have since migrated the code to HTML to make it compatible with static web hosting services such as Netlify and Vercel.

I fondly remember the many late nights we spent working on this project and the sheer excitement that followed the launch. This process of building something significant had a profound impact on me as a young man, so I hold it close to my heart.

Caleb went to be with our Lord earlier this year (2020). In honour of his memory and the early vision of Shift, I have put together this repository of our original work on the project.
